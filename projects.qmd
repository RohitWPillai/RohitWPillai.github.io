## Overview

My research uses molecular simulations to understand nanoscale phenomena at interfaces, with applications in thermal management, de-icing, and self-cleaning surfaces. I combine molecular dynamics with continuum methods to bridge scales from atoms to engineering devices.

## Current Projects

### Nanomaterial-Enhanced Cooling

High-performance electronics generate extreme heat fluxes that conventional cooling cannot handle. This project investigates how nanomaterials can enhance liquid cooling through:

- Nanoporous membranes for controlled evaporation
- Engineered solid-liquid interfaces for improved heat transfer
- Machine learning potentials for accurate molecular simulations

### Ice Nucleation and De-Icing

Understanding how ice forms at the nanoscale is crucial for designing surfaces that prevent icing on aircraft, wind turbines, and infrastructure. We study:

- Heterogeneous ice nucleation on different surface chemistries
- Effects of surface vibrations on ice formation
- Design principles for icephobic surfaces

### Nanoscale Heat Transfer

Heat flow across solid-liquid interfaces is governed by atomic-scale phenomena. We investigate:

- Spectral mechanisms of interfacial thermal conductance
- Effects of surface chemistry and structure
- Role of interfacial water structure

### Boiling and Bubble Dynamics

Phase change at surfaces is central to many cooling technologies. Our work explores:

- Heterogeneous vapour bubble nucleation
- Effects of surface wettability on bubble growth
- Acoustically-driven nanobubble dynamics

## Methods

### Molecular Dynamics

We use classical MD with both empirical potentials and machine-learning interatomic potentials to simulate systems of millions of atoms over nanosecond timescales.

### Multiscale Modelling

Our group develops methods to couple molecular simulations with continuum solvers, enabling simulation of macroscale problems while retaining nanoscale physics at interfaces.

### High-Performance Computing

Simulations run on UK national supercomputers (ARCHER2, CIRRUS) and institutional HPC facilities.
