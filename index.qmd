I am a computational engineering scientist at the **University of Edinburgh**, exploring the nanoscale world through simulation.

My research combines **molecular dynamics** with **continuum mechanics** to understand how droplets move, how surfaces clean themselves, and how heat flows at interfaces. Current focus areas include:

- **Boiling & evaporation** at nanoscale surfaces
- **Ice nucleation** and icephobic surface design
- **Nanoscale heat transfer** at solid-liquid interfaces
- **Machine learning potentials** for molecular simulations

I lead a research group primarily funded by an **ERC Starting Grant** (NANO-COOL, 2024-2029) investigating nanomaterial-enhanced cooling for extreme thermal management.

Published in **Physical Review Letters**, **Nano Letters**, and **Journal of Fluid Mechanics**. Research featured in **BBC**, **The Times**, **Metro**, and **The Conversation**.
