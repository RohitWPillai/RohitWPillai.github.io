I am a Senior Lecturer in Mechanical Engineering at the University of Edinburgh, with a background and publication record in continuum fluid dynamics, molecular dynamics, and multiphysics modelling.

My research has featured in prominent journals (Physical Review Letters, Nano Letters), the press (BBC, Times, Metro), and led to a radio interview on BBC Newsnight Scotland.

## Research Interests

- Molecular dynamics simulations
- Multiscale modelling
- Interfacial phenomena
- Droplet dynamics
- Phase change processes

## Education
