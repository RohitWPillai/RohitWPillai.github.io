## Courses

### Thermofluids 3 (Course Organiser, 2020-2024)

Third-year undergraduate course combining heat transfer and fluid mechanics. I redesigned this course in 2020-21, introducing:

- MOOC-style lecture videos with integrated worked examples
- Learning modules with curated real-world applications and research links
- Design-focused laboratory exercises using real experimental data
- Physical demonstrations (Stirling engines, radiometers, heat pipes)
- Structured feedback system for consistent, actionable assessment

### Engineering Mathematics 2A (2018-2023)

Second-year course covering mathematical methods for engineers, including differential equations and linear algebra.

### Engineering 1 (2018-2019)

First-year introductory engineering course providing foundation in core engineering principles.

## Student Supervision

### BEng/MEng Projects

I supervise 2-3 final-year BEng/MEng projects annually on topics including:

- Molecular dynamics of phase change
- Heat transfer at nanoscale interfaces
- Surface acoustic wave effects on droplets and particles

### Industrial Placements

Supervised 8 students on industrial placement programmes (2019-2021).
